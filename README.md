#### *BLANK TEMPLATE*
Basic frontend template for projects using Html, Css and Js.

Make sure to rename the repo folder, after you clone it, so that you don't confuse yourself later. Try renaming when you clone:

``` bash
git clone CLONE_URL your_project_name
```
and run this
``` 
	- npm i   
	- gulp 
```
